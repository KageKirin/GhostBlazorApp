# Ghost Blazor App

A [Ghost blog](https://ghost.org/) frontend app running on
[Maui Blazor](https://github.com/dotnet/docs-maui/blob/main/docs/user-interface/controls/blazorwebview.md).

## Usage

Fork and customize to create a frontend application for a specific Ghost blog.
This effectively uses the Ghost backend as CMS via its REST API.

(Or via a `JSON` theme that mimicks the REST API).
